# Manifolds

Package __Manifolds__ aims to provide both a unified interface to define and
use manifolds as well as a library of manifolds to use for your projects.

## Interface

```@autodocs
Modules = [ManifoldsBase]
Pages = ["ManifoldsBase.jl"]
Order = [:type, :function]
```

```@autodocs
Modules = [Manifolds, ManifoldsBase]
Pages = ["Manifolds.jl"]
Order = [:type, :function]
```

## Decorators

* [Array manifold](@ref)
* [Metric manifold](@ref)
